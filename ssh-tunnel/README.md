# SSH Tunnel Connector (planned)

This folder will contain scripts and docs for building resilient SSH tunnels
between remote clients and an OpenClaw gateway (e.g., laptop → gateway
port-forwarding, automatic reconnection, CLI defaults). Implementation is still
in progress. Check back soon or open an issue/PR if you want to collaborate.
