# Reverse Proxy Connector (planned)

Future home for nginx/Traefik/Apache-focused recipes where an existing reverse
proxy terminates TLS and forwards to the OpenClaw gateway. Once documented, the
connector will include sample configs, helper scripts, and migration notes for
users already running those proxies.
